Need to figure out the high level architecture:
1)All client Side - Use caching to maintain status for an IP. Would need to parse the google html result somehow.

2)Add serverside - Make the restful api call from the server. Also storing status in a DB.

2)
	Web browsers only allow a page to issue AJAX queries to the domain from which the page originated. This prevents cross-site scripting, a nasty attack method.

If you control the domain, AJAX is very useful.

If you don't control the domain, you should setup a server which requests the data and serves it (either on page load, or through AJAX) to the desired subpage.

3) Javascript can't be included in Footer
