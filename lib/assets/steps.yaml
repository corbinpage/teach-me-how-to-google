        Do you see results? Like for jaguar the car. Try using a dash or minus ("-") to REMOVE ANY REFERENCES to the car. Try searching "jaguar -car"

        Cool huh? Now we don't have any references to jaguar the car. But we're still trying to figure out the jaguar's top speed, so try searching  for  "jaguar speed".

        Doesn't look like you're narrowing the search down to speed. Try "'jaguar speed' -car".

        "Jaguars are freakin' awesome"
